# Backbone.CrossDomain

Note: This is being actively developed, so I wouldn't recommend using it in production until it actually works ;)

## Overview

An extension for Backbone.js with a Sync that works with IE 7-9 using its XDomainRequest.

This is intended as a drop-in replacement for the default Backbone.sync so you should be able to just plop this in and Cross Domain Requests (using CORS) will just magically work on IE.

## Installation

```
npm install Backbone.CrossDomain
```
